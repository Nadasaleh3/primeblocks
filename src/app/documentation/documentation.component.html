    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>PrimeBlocks for Angular consists of copy paste ready UI blocks crafted with PrimeFlex where theming and interactivity is provided by PrimeNG.</p>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>PrimeBlocks library requires PrimeNG v11.4.4+ and PrimeFlex v3.2.0+.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What is a Block?</h2>
        <p>A UI block is a set of html elements styled with the <span (click)="OpenPage('first')" 
            style="cursor:pointer;color:blue"> PrimeFlex </span> utility library. A block can also contain PrimeNG components in addition to regular elements. The blocks are designed to be used easily by simply moving the block code to your own application. This is achieved by defining the styling in the markup without using a custom css declaration. In cases where a block requires interactivity such as toggling the visibility of a menu or a sidebar, pStyleClass directive of PrimeNG manages the events and animations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Theming</h2>
        <p>Blocks utilize color classes for background, text color, border color and pseudo states.
             Color values are derived from the PrimeNG theme being used so that a block can seamlesslly integrate with your application.
              For example  <code  style="color:blue">bg-blue-500 </code>class retrieves the background color using the <code  style="color:blue">--blue-500 </code> CSS variables from PrimeNG. See <span (click)="OpenPage('first')" 
              style="cursor:pointer;color:blue">  PrimeNG colors </span> palettes for more information.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Setup</h1>
        <h2>PrimeFlex</h2>
        <p>PrimeFlex v3.1+ needs to be installed to begin with. </p>
        <pre class="code">
            <code> npm install primeflex --save</code>
        </pre>
       
    
    </div>
    <div> 
         <p>Next step is adding the primeflex.css at <code class="code">src/styles.scss</code> file</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
     
    <pre class="code">
        <code>
            &#64;import "primeflex/primeflex.css";
        </code>
    </pre>
        <!-- <p>Here is the @import rule as code:</p> -->
    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>pStyleClass directive</h2>
        <p>Many of the blocks like a navbar may require interactivity for opening or hiding a menu. A handy directive called pStyleClass is available via PrimeNG to bring interactivity easily. The directive adds a click event to its host and manages the enter/leave animation of a target. Load the StyleClassModule from PrimeNG and import it to your module just like you are using a PrimeNG component.
    
        </p>
    
    
            <pre class="code">
                <code>
                    import &#123;StyleClassModule&#125; from 'primeng/styleclass'&#59;</code>
            </pre>
            <!-- <code>import {StyleClassModule} from 'primeng/styleclass';
            </code> -->
        
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Font Settings</h2>
    <p>PrimeBlocks use the font derived from the PrimeNG theme being used, you may still use them with a font of your choice however to have the same look when a block is copied to your own page, add the config below to your application.
    
    </p>
    <pre class="code">
        <code>
            
          <span style="color:green"> body</span>   &#123;
          <span style="color:red">font-family: </span><span style="color:green">var</span>(--font-family);
          <span style="color:red">-webkit-font-smoothing: </span>antialiased;
          <span style="color:red">-moz-osx-font-smoothing: </span>grayscale;

            When using a utility CSS library like PrimeFlex, it is likely to use only a set of classes from the library leaving the rest of the library as unused. To avoid including the unused part in your application, it is strongly recommended to use a tool like PurgeCSS that analyzes your code and generates an optimized primeflex file that only contains the utilities you've used.
